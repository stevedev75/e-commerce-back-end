# E-Commerce Back End

## Application to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. 

My motivation for this project was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by wirking with the Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySqyl database. 

I built this project, in part, to showcase my understanding of JavaScript, Sequelize, MySql and the Insomnia application which was use for testing. 

This application solves the problem often of how to build the back end of a website that connects to a database.

In this project, I learned a lot -- more specifically -- about Sequelize, MySQL, databases, Insomnia and additional information about JavaScript.
